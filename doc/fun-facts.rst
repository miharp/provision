The Rebar Analogy
-----------------

We feel strongly about the rebar and reinforced data center analogy.

`Rebar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebar>`_ is steel (metal) that is embedded into `reinforced concrete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforced_concrete>`_ to make it structurally durable.  It was an essential innovation that allows building cloudscraping towers and more robust infrastructure.

Digital rebar provides a similar underlaying framework to reinforce data centers.

The (Re)bar Second Meaning
--------------------------

Rebar is also a nod to our Crowbar history.  The project founders were the original Crowbar founders.  In very practical terms, the Digital Rebar project is a reimagined implementation of Crowbar.

Rebar also works as a reference to the "bare metal" physical infrastructure that Digital Rebar focused on automating.

Our Metal Bear Mascot
---------------------

The Digital Rebar mascot is a metal bear named Cloudia.  She loves bare metal infrastructure but is not as crazy about heavy metal music.

There are three ways that Cloudia appears: floading on a cloud, as a bear alone and just her head.

First Commit
------------

The first code commit to Digital Rebar was made by Greg Althaus on Feb 8, 2017.  It was appropriately titled "first commit" and set the README.md to "# rocket-skates".

Rocket Skates?
--------------

Rocket Skates was the working name for Digital Rebar Provision during initial development.  Since they are fast and powerful boots, it seemed like a natural name for a Cobbler replacement.
