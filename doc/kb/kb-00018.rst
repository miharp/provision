kb-00018: Can I eliminate reboots with kexec?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _rs_kexec:

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00018
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

Installing operating systems often times requires a reboot of the Machine several times.  For
physical (aka *bare*) metal, this reboot cycle can add many minutes (often times 10 or more
minutes) to the installation process.

When installing Linux operating systems, it may be possible to utilize the Linux Kernel *kexec*
mechanism to "exec" in to the new Kernel environment without requiring the Machine to pass through
a full POST cycle.


Solution
--------

Setting the `kexec-ok` param to `true` on the `global` or machine specific profile allows
BootEnvs that are *kexec* enabled to skip rebooting when changing to that BootEnv.  For example,
Sledgehammer enables *kexec* and can be started without a reboot from Linux environments.

This is a Linux specific feature.

.. note:: The *kexec* capability is defined by the compiled Linux Kernel configuration.  Some Linux
          distributions do not enable *kexec* by default.  In these cases, you may have to compile
          a custom kernel version with *kexec* enabled.  In addition, not all transition states can
          successfully utilize *kexec* even if it is enabled in the kernel.
