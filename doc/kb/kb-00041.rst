kb-00041: Manager and System Time

--------------------------------


Description
-----------

The Multi-site Manager system requires all DRP Endpoints that are being managed to have consistent and accurate
system clock date and time information.  Generally speaking, all Endpoints should have NTP services running,
and all RTC clocks set to UTC.  The Authentication Tokens and Secrets used for the token system will by design
fail if the clocks between two cooperating DRP Endpoint differ more than a few minutes.  This is an intentional
security measure.


Solution
--------

If you encounter any of the following errors on "upstream" DRP Managers, this is often the system clocks being
out of sync:

  Machine Objects may show the following:
  ::

    (403) system:
    Invalid token: No valid key specified


  Plugins may show the following:
  ::

    Unable to create event stream: Bad Request

  or even Golang stack traces in some (eg IPMI plugin):
  ::

    Panic recovered: invalid WriteHeader code 0
    Stack trace:
    goroutine 33 [running]:
    runtime/debug.Stack(0x991080, 0xc000289510, 0x1)
	  /home/travis/.gimme/versions/go1.12.7.linux.amd64/src/runtime/debug/stack.go:24 +0x9d
    ...snip...

In addition, Machine objects may show additional failed validation error messages in the Machine details pages.

To correct the problem, install and verify all DRP Endpoints system clocks are in sync with NTP services.
