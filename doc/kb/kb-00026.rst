kb-00026: Change a Machines Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _rs_change_machine_name:

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00026
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

This article describes how an operator can attempt to change a Machine's defined name, inside
the deployed Operating System.

.. note:: Machine name changes must be supported by the *Workflow* being executed, to affect the
          change inside the Operating System.  Most RackN and Digital Rebar provided content
          supports this methodology.  However, if you are customizing your kickstart or preseed
          templates, this process may not work if you have not arranged for these Param values
          to be utilized.

Solution
--------

If you wish to update/change a Machine Name, you can do:

  ::

    export UUID="abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst"
    drpcli machines update $UUID '{ "Name": "foobar" }'

.. note:: Note that you can NOT use the ``drpcli machines set ...`` construct as it only sets Param values.
          The Machines name is a Field, not a Parameter.  This will NOT work: ``drpcli machines set $UUID
          param Name to foobar``.
