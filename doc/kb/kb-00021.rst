Description
-----------

This document describes information on how to control Task exit, and how it is handled
by the DRP Workflow system.


Solution
--------

The Runner Task execution system supports many ways to cause a system reboot that allow for the
task being marked as either complete or incomplete (so it can resume).  This can be very
important for tasks that require a reboot mid-task.

These options are handled by using script helpers or sending specialized ``exit`` codes.  Please
see :ref:`rs_workflow_reboot` for comprehensive documentation.
