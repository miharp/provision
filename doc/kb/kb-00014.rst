kb-00014: Debug Sledgehammer Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _rs_debug_sledgehammer:

Knowledge Base Article: kb-00014
--------------------------------


Description
-----------

From time to time, a Machines environment, hostname, or other factors may cause
the *Sledgehammer* (also called *Discovery*) BootEnv to fail to boot or start
*Workflow* successfully.  In these cases, you will need to log in to the Machines
console, and debug the problem.

Solution
--------

If the sledgehammer discovery image should fail to launch Runner jobs successfully, or other
issues arise with the start up sequences, you can debug start up via the systemd logging.  Log
in to the console of the Machine in question (or if SSH is running and you have ``access-keys``
setup, you can SSH in), and run the following command to output logging:

  ::

      journalctl -u sledgehammer
