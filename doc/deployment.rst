Deployment Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Digital Rebar Provision is intended to be deployed as both a DHCP server and a Provisioner.  There are cases where
one or the other are desired.  Each feature can be disabled by command line flags.

* *--disable-dhcp* - Turns off the DHCP server
* *--disable-provisioner* - Turns off the Provisioner servers (TFTP and HTTP)

The :ref:`rs_api` doesn't change based upon these flags, only the services being provided.


DHCP Disabled
-------------

If a DHCP environment already exists or a more declarative mode is more desirable, there are a couple of things in each case to be aware of.
For either case, the underlying assumption is that something will direct the node to use
the provisioner as its *NextBoot* server.

Declarative Mode
================

Each machine must be declared through the :ref:`rs_cli` or the :ref:`rs_api`.
The IP address in the :ref:`rs_model_machine` will be used to populate the :ref:`rs_model_bootenv` information.  The
provisioner will provide these files through TFTP and HTTP.  It is left to the admin to figure out how to get the
node to reference them.


External DHCP
=============

With DHCP disabled, the admin can provide a DHCP server for distributing addresses.  The DHCP will need to do
the following:

* Set NextServer to an IP that routes to Digital Rebar Provision
* Set Option 3 (gateway) - This is optional, but may be required depending on the network routing.
* Set Option 6 (dns server) - This is optional, but often useful in conjunction with Option 15.
* Set Option 15 (dns domain) - This is needed for discovery boots to construct a meaningful FQDN for the node.
* Set Option 67 (bootfile) - This is required and can be complex, see below.

Setting a bootfile is required.  If you have only one architecture and boot mode, this is simply the name
of the bootloader.  For example, if you are only booting legacy bios x86 systems, then you can set *lpxelinux.0*
and be done.  If you have to support both UEFI and Legacy or multiple architecture types or iPXE as well, you will
need a more complex configuration.

For example, this snippet works for most systems when using the ISC DHCP Server.  It will set the bootfile
for legacy, UEFI, or iPXE booting clients and set the next server parameter to *192.168.100.3*.  Place this
snippet inside a subnet or host definition.

  ::

    if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
      filename "default.ipxe";
    } else if option arch = 00:07 {
      filename "ipxe.efi";
    } else if option arch = 00:09 {
      filename "ipxe.efi";
    } else {
      filename "ipxe.pxe";
    }
    next-server 192.168.100.3;


Provisioner Disabled
--------------------

In this mode, Digital Rebar Provision acts as a DHCP server only.  The :ref:`rs_dhcp_models` describe how to use the server.
Set the DHCP options that will direct to the next boot servers and other needs.
